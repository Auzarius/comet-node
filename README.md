# comet-node
A recreation of the previous inshop ticket system that was using PHP and MYSQL.  This version will use Node.js, Express.js, AngularJS and the node-mysql tie in most likely.

I am open to feedback to help along the development.
This is just a small project I am working on in my spare time.
This will also server as my first node.js project and also my first real javascript project.

Currently working on:
  Finishing up the database functions for interfacing with the MySQL server,
  Completing all of the API routes so the Angular front end can begin development
  
To-do:
  Complete the node API
  Write the angular front end

    :Create, Update, Delete and view tickets
    :Create and view ticket events
