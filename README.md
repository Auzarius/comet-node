# comet-node
A recreation of the previous inshop ticket system that was using PHP and MYSQL.  This version will use Node.js, Express.js, AngularJS and the node-mysql tie in most likely.

I am open to feedback to help along the development.
This is just a small project I am working on in my spare time.
This will also server as my first node.js project and also my first real javascript project.

Currently working on:
  :Just launched the first full version with the completed database migration.  There could be more to come as bugs or other usages are requested.
  
To-do:
  :Nothing to see here (at this time)
